<h2>Blaze is a Generalization of NumPy<a class="headerlink" href="#blaze-is-a-generalization-of-numpy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="_images/numpy_plus.png" class="align-center" src="_images/numpy_plus.png" />
<p>We would like the NDTable to be a Generalization of NumPy.  Whether this means
that the NDTable augments or replaces NumPy (on the Python side) in the future
has yet to be determined.  For now, it will augment NumPy and provide
compatibility whenever possible.</p>
<p>In addition to the ufuncs defined over NumPy arrays, NumPy defines basically 3
things that we wish to generalize:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A data-type</li>
<li>A shape</li>
<li>A strides map to a single data-buffer (a linear, formula-based index)</li>
</ul>
<p>These concepts are generalized via the concept of DataDescriptors.
NumPy-style arrays consist of a single data-segment that can be explained via a
linear indexing function with strides as the coefficients.  In addition to
serving as a dispatch mechanism for functions, the dtype also participates in
indexing operations via the itemsize, and structure data-types.</p>
<p>NumPy is a pointer to memory with &#8220;indexing&#8221; information provided by strides.
While we don&#8217;t typically think of NumPy arrays as having an &#8220;index&#8221;, the
strides attribute provides a linear, formula-based index so that A[I] maps to
mem[I cdot s] where mem is the memory buffer for the array, I is the
index-vector, and s is the strides vector.</p>
<p>Blaze generalizes this notion to multiple data-buffers and (necessarily)
different kinds of indexes.   Domain-experts are not going to care (much)
about the details of how this lays out (just as today most users of NumPy don&#8217;t
care about the strides).  However, algorithm writers will care a great deal
about the actual data-layout of an NDTable and want to process the elements of
an array in the easiest possible way.  The ByteProvider and DataDescriptor
interfaces allow algorithm writers to get at this information.</p>
<p>One concept which will remain true is that some algorithms will work faster and
more optimally with data laid out in a certain way.  As a result, an NDTable
may have several data-layouts to choose from which can be selected as needed
for optimization.</p>
<img alt="_images/distributed.png" class="align-center" src="_images/distributed.png" />
<p>Blaze will allow analysts and scientists to productively write robust
and efficient code, without getting bogged down in the details of how
to distribute computation, or worse, how to transport and convert data
between databases, formats, proprietary data warehouses, and other
silos.</p>
<img alt="_images/global.png" class="align-center" src="_images/global.png" />
<p>The core of Blaze is a generic N-dimensional array/table object with a
general “data type” and “data shape” in a robust type system
for all kinds of data; especially semi-structured, sparse, and columnar
data. Blaze’s generalized calculation engine can iterate over the
distributed array or table and dispatch to specialized kernels.</p>

<h3>New Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#new-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Datashape:</dt>
<dd>A generalization of the &#8220;tuple of integral sizes&#8221; approach found in
NumPy, C, and FORTRAN.  The Shape tuple consists of a variety of Primitive
and Complex dimension specifiers, including Fixed integers (corresponding
to NumPy fixed-length dimensions), Variable-length dimensions, Union,
Enum, Bitfield, and CType (for traditional C data types).  Most
significantly, there is also a Record shape type, which is composed of
additional specifiers for its named fields.  It is the Record Shape which
gives rise to the distinction between Blaze&#8217;s Tabular and ArrayLike
objects.</dd>
<dt>NDTable:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A Tabular object with lazy evaluation of data, but immediate evaluation
of index space transformations.  Once data has been evaluated, then it
is cached on the NDTable object.  Operations on NDTables will generally
return NDTable.</p>
<p class="last">NDTable is intended for library and infrastructure code, and its interface
is designed with consistency and programmatic handling of errors as the
primary focus, and command-line usability as secondary.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Table:</dt>
<dd>A node in an expression graph on Tabular objects; basically an even more
lazily evaluated NDTable.  Even index transformations are not computed
immediately, but rather on-demand.  Operations on Tables may return Tables
or NDTables, depending on the circumstance.  The Table is meant to be used
at a REPL and in simple scripts, and its interface and methods are
designed for usability by end-users.</dd>
<dt>NDArray:</dt>
<dd>Same concept as NDTable, but for the ArrayLike interface.</dd>
<dt>Array:</dt>
<dd>Same concept as Table, but for ArrayLike.</dd>
<dt>Indexable:</dt>
<dd>Any object which supports indexing by scalars to retrieve individual
elements, and slicing (indexing by more complex objects, usually Tuples)
to retrieve subsets or subspaces.  There is no concept of &#8220;shape&#8221; here in
the classical NumPy sense; an Indexable should be considered to be
one-dimensional.  However, there is no restriction nor guarantee on the
type and size of its elements.</dd>
<dt>ByteProvider:</dt>
<dd>An Indexable object which only returns DataDescriptors.  This type of
Indexable object is specifically distinguished from other Indexable
objects because Blaze arrays/tables are recursive data structures, and can
nest freely.  A ByteProvider is a primitive indexed object that is
guaranteed to produce concrete data.  It does not have a concept of
dimensions or shape.</dd>
<dt>DataSpace:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The most fundamental and most general multi-dimensional object in Blaze.
It has a &#8220;shape&#8221;, although it should be noted that the Blaze Shape object
is a very rich structure, beyond the standard &#8220;list of strides and
offsets&#8221; which exists in NumPy and other dense, matrix-oriented libraries.</p>
<p>The methods and operations available on DataSpace are related to
selection, query, and reshape of the coordinate structure defined by the
space&#8217;s Shape.  There are no general arithmetic functions (as there are
with Arrays) and there are no indexing and set-oriented operations (as
there are with Tables).</p>
<p class="last">DataSpace is Indexable, and so can be generically treated as a 1D array of
its outermost dimension, but there are no restrictions on the shape or
type of each element in it.  In the most general case, it would need to be
treated as a Stream of arbitrarily-shaped subspaces.</p>
</dd>
<dt>DataDescriptor:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A wrapper or reference to concrete data in memory, on disk, or elsewhere
that is directly accessible by the low-level Blaze runtime.  Consists of
buffers and streams (or lists of buffers or of streams).  Buffers are like
NumPy arrays or Python memoryviews, and can potentially be strided views
of contiguous memory.  Streams are like character devices in the Unix
model, with a few additional parameters for optimal chunked reading.</p>
<p>DataDescriptors themselves are not Indexable; they should be thought of as
a glorified &#8220;pointer&#8221; to bulk data, or a handle for a stream.  They do
have the concept of a traditional NumPy dtype to specify the kinds of
elements they return, but they do not need to implement any slicing,
broadcasting, or shape-related functionality.</p>
<p class="last">Internally, Blaze tries to use DataDescriptors as much as possible,
instead of shipping memory around.  Ultimately, kernel functions and other
low-level parts of the runtime will use DataDescriptors to actually read
or copy data, and they use the metadata and flags on DataDescriptors to
adapt their inner loops to the layout of the data.</p>

<div class="section" id="numpy-shapes-two-ways">
<h2>NumPy Shapes, Two Ways<a class="headerlink" href="#numpy-shapes-two-ways" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For instance, the classical C/FORTRAN/NumPy N-D array is usually
described with a shape that is a tuple of integers. Each integer
indicates the number of subspaces which are stacked together, and the
dimensions of each subspace is then specified by the remainder of the
shape tuple.</p>
<p>There is also a natural geometric interpretation of this. If the shape
tuple has length N, then the left-most integer can be interpreted as
defining a vector in an N-dimensional space that is dual to the subspace
defined by shape[1:N]. The shape[0:N] generates the space by extruding
the subspace shape[1:N] along that vector, much like an outer product.
This outer product formulation is recursive, and one can start with the
right-most integer in a shape tuple and build out the entire space.</p>
<p>In this multi-dimensional, dense cube view, transpose() and reshape()
are just volume-preserving transformations of this cube. Since each
dimension is defined by a vector, there is no simple way to label
dimensions or create any address space that does not have a strict
mapping onto the integers. Sparse arrays, categorical dimensions, and
even hierarchical dimensions are usually handled by enumerating a
tuple space of keys. While this makes selection of individual elements
possible, it can be awkward to slice or select ranges, because the
topological structure of the index space has been collapsed onto the
integers.</p>
<img alt="_images/nested.png" class="align-center" src="_images/nested.png" />
<p>Another, somewhat unorthodox, view is to consider the coordinate space
not as a multi-dimensional dense cube, but rather as a hierarchical
tree of indices. Each tree node has an ordered set of child nodes, and
every set of child nodes is numbered starting at 0. (The actual data
is located in the terminal leaf nodes of the tree.) The NumPy-style
selection of &#8220;planes&#8221; of subspaces, e.g. a[:, 2, :], is akin to
selecting all the child nodes of a certain index number (in this case,
2) at a specific layer or level of the tree from the root.</p>
<p>This tree-view of traditional dense arrays has some nice properties.
Since it is intrinsically about enumerating a set of leaf nodes, and
there is no implicit geometric structure, it&#8217;s easier to visualize how
ragged (variable-length) arrays and other irregularities might fit into
the overall scheme. &#8220;Shape&#8221; is a property of the tree and the non-leaf
nodes, and the tree-view makes it more apparently how hierarchical and
other indexing approaches may lead to equally valid and useful mappings
over the set of values in the leaf nodes.</p>
<p>A Table is a Python object that allows N-dimensional + &#8220;named fields&#8221;
indexing.  It is a generalization of NumPy, Pandas, data array, larry, ctable,
and CArray, and is meant to serve as a foundational abstraction on which to
build out-of-core and distributed algorithms by focusing attention away from
moving data to the code and rather layering interpretation on top of data that
exists.</p>
<img alt="_images/codepush.png" class="align-center" src="_images/codepush.png" />
<img alt="_images/datapull.png" class="align-center" src="_images/datapull.png" />
<p>There are two interfaces to Blaze Tabular objects:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Domain expert interface that allows easy construction, indexing,
manipulation and computation.  This is served by the interface and
methods on Table objects.</li>
<li>Algorithm writers and developers searching for a unified API that allows
coherent communication about the structure of data for optimization.
This is served by the NDTable object.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is intended to be <em>the</em> glue that holds the PyData ecosystem together.   It
has an interface for domain experts to query their information and an interface
for algorithm writers to create out-of-core algorithms against.   The long-term
goal is for NDTable to be the interface that <em>all</em> PyData projects interact
with.</p>
<p>It is the calculations / operations that can be done with a Table that will
ultimately matter and define whether or not it gets used in the Python
ecosystem.  We need to make it easy to create these calculations and algorithms
and push to grow this ecosystem rapidly.</p>
<p>At the heart of Table is a delayed-evaluation system (like SymPy, Theano, and
a host of other tools).  As a result, every operation actually returns a node
of a simple, directed graph of functions and arguments (also analogous to
DyND).  However, as far as possible, these nodes will propagate meta-data and
meta-compute (such as dtype, and shape, and index-iterator parameters so that
the eventual calculation framework can reason about how to manage the
calculation.</p>
<img alt="_images/graph.png" class="align-center" src="_images/graph.png" />
<p>The methods and operators on Tables will be similar to those available in the
projects mentioned above: Pandas, larry, CArray/ctable, etc.</p>
<img alt="_images/sources.png" class="align-center" src="_images/sources.png" />
<p>DataDescriptors are objects that represent connections to raw memory, files,
HTTP URLs, GPU memory, database connections, measurements, procedurally
generated data, or any other byte streams.  The main concept is that
throughout the Blaze compilation and execution engines, only descriptions of
data are transported and mutated, and buffers of data themselves are not read
or copied unless absolutely necessary.  There should be enough metadata in a
DataDescriptor so that the Blaze low-level run time can easily and efficiently
process the data as it needs it.</p>
<p>There are four basic types of DataDescriptors: Buffer, Stream, List of
Buffers, and List of Streams.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Buffer:</dt>
<dd>Random-access capable, suited for data parallel approaches.  Compatible
with NumPy and with Python memoryviews.  Generally refers to a single
contiguous region of memory or file pointer on disk (although the strides
may be heterogeneous).  Has some underlying C-compatible data type as
its element specification, and also has some flags (such as Writable,
etc.)</dd>
<dt>Stream:</dt>
<dd>Streaming interface for data that cannot be read in a data parallel way.
Flags and C-compatible elements types just like Buffers, but has actual
data read functions.  Stream metadata includes hinting for optimal chunks
in which to read data.</dd>
<dt>BufferList:</dt>
<dd>A list of noncontiguous Buffer objects.  Has many of the same properties
of the Buffer, most significantly, can be accessed in parallel.</dd>
<dt>StreamList:</dt>
<dd>A list of independent streams.  They might be chained (read one after the
other), or zipped (read in parallel).</dd>
