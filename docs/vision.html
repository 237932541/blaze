<p>Blaze is a generalization of NumPy to multiple byte segments, arbitrary
data-types, and heterogeneous shapes. These generalizations allow Blaze
to be the foundation for a new generation of large-scale computing
algorithms and systems.</p>
<p>Blaze has an array-oriented type system that dresses raw bytes in a
global address space at run-time with meta-information that informs how
segments can be referenced and how the data will be used in computation.
It is a system for allowing information held in bytes to be typed and
indexed as N-dimensional arrays and tables. These bytes can then be used
in calculations composed of a single expression or an entire program and
then executed on heterogeneous hardware (multiple nodes, multiple cores,
and multiple GPUs). The run-time library and type-system is extensible
to handle computations of all kinds.</p>
<p>Just as NumPy is the center of an ecosystem of singe-node, in-memory
tools that use the NumPy array as a common shared abstraction around
a single pointer to memory, Blaze is the center of an ecosystem
of multiple-node, multiple-segment, and multiple calculation-unit
algorithms and programs. The common meme in effective use of Blaze is
that developers should think about their data and the operations that
should be done on their data in an array-oriented fashion, and that code
should be moved to data as much as possible.</p>
<p>To enable this, Blaze has a compiler to create machine code based on the
LLVM infrastructure. It also has a family of adapters to data-storage
formats of all kinds so that expert time can be spent processing data
and not converting data from one format to another. A blaze-program
makes reference to data URLs, or builds up arrays from computed
results. These arrays or tables of information are then operated on by
expressions that create resulting output. The expressions are lazily
evaluated until results are needed at which time computation is broken
down and scheduled on the available hardware as close to the data as
possible &#8212; either automatically or using directives provided by the
programmer.</p>
