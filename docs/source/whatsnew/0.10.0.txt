Release |version|
-----------------

:Release: |version|
:Date: TBD

New Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The ``sample`` expression allows random sampling of rows to facilitate
  interactive data exploration (:issue:`1410`).  It is implemented for the
  Pandas, Dask, SQL, and Python backends.

Improved Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The test suite was expanded to validate proper expression input error handling
  (:issue:`1420`).

New Backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~

None

Improved Backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Adds :class:`~blaze.expr.math.greatest` and :class:`~blaze.expr.math.least`
  support to the sql backend (:issue:`1428`).

Experimental Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

None

API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

* :func:`~blaze.interactive.Data` has been deprecated in favor of
  :func:`~blaze.interactive.data`.  :class:`~blaze.interactive.InteractiveSymbol`
  has been deprecated and temporarily replaced by
  :class:`~blaze.interactive._Data`.  These deprecations will be in place for
  the 0.10 release.  In the 0.11 release, :class:`~blaze.interactive._Data`
  will be renamed to ``Data``, calls to :func:`~blaze.interactive.data` will
  create ``Data`` instances, and :class:`~blaze.interactive.InteractiveSymbol`
  will be removed (:issue:`1431` and :issue:`1421`).
* :func:`~blaze.compute.core.compute` has a new keyword argument
  ``return_type`` which defaults to ``'native'`` (:issue:`1401`, :issue:`1411`,
  :issue:`1417`), which preserves existing behavior.  In the 0.11 release,
  ``return_type`` will be changed to default to ``'core'``, which will
  ``odo`` non-core backends into core backends as the final step in a call to
  ``compute``.
* Due to API instability and on the recommendation of DyND developers, we
  removed the DyND dependency temporarily (:issue:`1379`).  When DyND achieves
  its 1.0 release, DyND will be re-incorporated into Blaze.  The existing DyND
  support in Blaze was rudimentary and based on an egregiously outdated and
  buggy version of DyND.  We are aware of no actual use of DyND via Blaze in
  practice.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

None

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Adds logging to server compute endpoint.  Includes expression being computed
  and total time to compute. (:issue:`1436`)
