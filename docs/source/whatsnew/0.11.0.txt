Improved Backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* To allow access to the ``map`` and ``apply`` expressions in client / server
  interactions when in a trusted environment, new ``_trusted`` versions of the
  several default ``SerializationFormat`` instances were added.  These trusted
  variants allow (de)serialization of builtin functions, NumPy functions, and
  Pandas functions.  They are intentially kept separate from the default
  versions to ensure they are not accidentally enabled in untrusted
  environments (:issue:`1497` :issue:`1504`).

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed a bug with ``to_tree()`` and ``slice`` objects. Have to change the
  order of cases in ``to_tree()`` to ensure ``slice`` objects are handled
  before lookups inside the ``names`` namespace (:issue:`1516`).
* Perform more input validation for ``sort()`` expression arguments
  (:issue:`1517`).
