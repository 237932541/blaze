Playground directory
====================

Tests for humans, not robots.

This directory is for small tests used during development. Use this
directory to place those toy tests that are not intended for automatic
execution by the build machine.

This may also include interesting proof-of-concept code having to do
with blaze internals or even just illustrative samples of the
internals of blaze.
