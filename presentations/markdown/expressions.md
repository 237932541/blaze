# Expressions


* SymPy expressions...
    * encode mathematical equations as Python objects
    * generate numeric, high-performance, code
    * enable mathematical reasoning

<hr>

We combine high-level reasoning and low-level performance.


* Blaze expressions...
    * encode relational and linear algebra, rather than calculus and trigonometry
    * interpret to other systems
    * enable data reasoning
    * are extensible (in a way that keeps you sane)

<hr>

We combine high-level reasoning and low-level performance.
